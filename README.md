# About
The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the U.S. Digital Service are working together to focus on improving the way that the government procures digital services and solutions. OFPP and the US Digital Service recognize the need for improving and simplifying the digital experiences that citizens and businesses have with the Federal Government. Strengthening digital services expertise in the government is key to reduce the risk of failed acquisitions and systems, and save taxpayer dollars.  

[The Digital Service Academy](http://booz-allen-hamilton.github.io/digital-service-academy/) will integrate with other acquisitions training program to create a complete Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program. This program will provide participating Federal contracting professionals:

* The necessary training to become digital service procurement experts
* The knowledge necessary to be imbedded within agency Digital Service teams to serve as a business advisor to the team, its customers, and its stakeholders
* The skills, processes, best practices, and strategies to Digital Service procurements to reduce risk, eliminate waste, and increase efficiencies
