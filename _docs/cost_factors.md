## What are the cost assumptions of the Program?

Programs of this nature do not live in isolation, but rather they integrate with many existing public (Defense Acquisition University, FAC-C Certification) and private sector (General Assembly) offerings. At this stage of the concept, we recommend assessing total program costs in terms of:

1) Setup costs associated with developing content and imparting the training for the pilot

2) Ongoing cost per student after the pilot for an equivalent 3-6 month development effort

3) Monthly or yearly maintenance cost to continuously improve and inject fresh content and learning methods

Given the broad nature of this training, intensity and length, and the required specialization by both the facilitators and the participants, we anticipate a cost per participant equivalent to many modern education offerings out in the market today.

Many factors should be contemplated when calculating the overall cost of the program, including but not limited to:

* Government participant time (e.g., paid professional development or optional personal development, on weekdays or weekends, after hours)

* Government or private sector facilitator or SME time

* Facilities and additional materials for classroom training

* Initial content development by vendor(s)

* Ongoing online content management

* Online knowledge management and collaboration tool(s) configuration and maintenance

* Online infrastructure hosting and management (e.g., is the content hosted by DAU and thus a cost that does not need to be accounted for by this program)

* Train the trainer whereby the home organization absorbs cost of future iterations of the training by the trainer with the rest of his or her agencyâ€™s procurement office

* Speed of scale to the +10,000 IT professional services acquisition core
