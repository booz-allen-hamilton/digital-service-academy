## What are the options to pilot this Program?

The program content could be piloted using one of two approaches. Both of these approaches would adopt the Digital Service best practices of testing solutions and using an iterative approach to delivery.

1) Develop an in-depth segment of content. Pick one key topic or section of the Digital Service Playbook; design, develop, pilot, and evaluate the learning solution components for this one topic. The successes and failures learned from this segment would then be applied to development of the additional segments. This solution provides a cost-effective way of producing a program that will engage, apply to, and resonate with the digital service contracting professionals. The program can be scaled to include the priority topics and additional topics can be added in the future to create an even more robust and complete solution.

2) Go broad and develop a core program. A core program with the critical topics can be developed using an iterative approach with feedback to ensure success. After the core program is implemented and evaluated for effectiveness, additional topics can be added to make the program more robust. There are multiple advantages to this approach:

 - The program would be basic, but encompass the entire acquisitions process.
Once implemented, the participants will immediately apply new knowledge and skills to meet the program goal — improving the way the government builds and buys digital service.

 - One of the key success factors in this program is learning from experts and learning from peers. By establishing the core program first, the students who have completed the program can use their knowledge to contribute to the community and the curriculum through the Community of Practice (COP), presenting in the classes, or creating videos to support the learning.
 - The core program would be available as a separate track. Not all Contracting Officers, Contracting Officer’s Representatives, Program Leaders, and Contracting Specialists require the full training program. The core program, as initially developed, will stand on its own for an audience who needs only high-level or entry-level training on digital service acquisitions.

Based on Booz Allen Hamilton’s experience and expertise in learning strategy, the second option would provide a greater benefit as a pilot to learn and inform the design of tomorrow’s full-scale program.
