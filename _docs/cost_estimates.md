## What are the estimated costs to implement the Program?

Many of the start-up costs in the pilot will be allocated towards fundamental improvements to the content and learning methods, which will be informed by student feedback. The core curriculum and products developed will be modular and reusable by existing training and learning programs, reducing the cost per participant in the future. Taking these factors into account and comparing to similar offerings across the market today, the cost of the program is estimated below:

#### Cost of pilot = ~$320K — $450K

#### Cost per student for future iterations after the pilot = ~$5K — $6K (akin to similar level certification costs)

We also recognize that many Government Fiscal Year training budgetary plans may be determined by the time this pilot initiates. Assuming no additional government costs to engage and impart the pilot (e.g., student time), Booz Allen is confident it can design, develop, and execute a minimum viable version of the proposed experience with the planned challenge awards for winning proposals.
These cost estimates are subject to change based on the assumptions and possibilities of integrating with existing government learning programs. The solution will result in many tangible and intangible returns for the Federal Government.
