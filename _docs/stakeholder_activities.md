## What would be required from Program stakeholders?

The pilot will focus on developing new interactive content and tools in an iterative fashion. For the best results, we recommend a diverse group of stakeholders from key agencies participate. The following is an initial set of government stakeholders required and commitments to make this a successful pilot.

### Step
#### Activities
 - Government Stakeholder Requirements

### Setting the Stage

### Program Design
#### Establish the learning objectives, delivery methods, material resources, and sequence for effective and efficient learning tools

 - Input on program priorities, learning goals, processes details, realistic scenarios, and existing resources

### Program Development
#### Development of tools, course materials, assets, and COP sites would be developed based on the design

- SME reviews would be required to ensure the information is accurate, complete, and will meet the learning goals

- Meetings and interviews with the target audience will offer insight into the needs and delivery methods

### Implementation
#### SME delivery

 - Acquisitions experts (SMEs) will be needed to participate as guest speakers and contribute to COP activity

 - Logistics support for identifying participants and arranging training sessions

 - Members of the potential audience to participate in the pilot sessions from start-to-finish

### Evaluation
