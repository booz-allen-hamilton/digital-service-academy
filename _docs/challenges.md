## What are contracting professionals asking themselves?

_How do I use free Open Source architecture to quickly re-design my .gov and build a new content management system while adding the flexibility to migrate back to the legacy license-based stack in the future?_

_If I want to develop a new case management system on a Salesforce SaaS platform, how can I be connected with other buyers across the enterprise to drive efficiencies?_

_How much does it cost for an enterprise-wide license agreement I can utilize to build new business intelligence reports?_

_Where can I find libraries of contract templates, language, and clauses for successful procurements that acquired agile sprints or time-boxed releases with loosely defined requirements?_

_Is there a way for me to invite vendors to show me what they can quickly produce with some publicly available data sets in the form of clickable prototypes or demos before committing to a longer-term agreement?_
